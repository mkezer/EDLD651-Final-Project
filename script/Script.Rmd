This presentation is very handy, I usually install and load my packages line by line so will be using this notion for speed.
# Data Preparation

## Load data and clean names
We first load the datasets and clean the variable names.
```{r load data}
#setwd("D:/Master/EDLD651/peerreview/EDLD651-Final-Project")

election <- import(here("data", "countypres_2000-2016.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() #load election results

s_capital_97 <- import(here("data", "social-capital-variables-for-1997.xlsx")) %>% 
  clean_names() #load social capital data for 1997

s_capital_05 <- import(here("data", "social-capital-variables-for-2005.xlsx")) %>% 
  clean_names() #load social capital data for 2005

s_capital_09 <- import(here("data", "social-capital-variables-for-2009.xlsx")) %>% 
  clean_names() #load social capital data for 2009

s_capital_14 <- import(here("data", "social-capital-variables-spreadsheet-for-2014.xlsx")) %>% 
  clean_names()#load social capital data for 2014

```

## Clean data
### Election data
- We start with the election data as it is more comprehensive in terms of the number of counties. First, we select the variables of interests. Then, we select the election year (i.e., 2000, 2008, 2012, 2016) that we will match with social capital data.  

- The name of the year variable is changed in a way that shows it is the year of election (so that it is not mixed with the same year variable in social capital data).  

- We create new datasets for each presidential election we are interested in. These will be later merged with corresponding social capital data.  

### Social capital data
- For each social capital dataset (i.e., 1997, 2005, 2009, 2014), we first add state code for some counties that do not readily contain that information. Then, we create two variables out of the area name such that we have different variables for county names and state codes.  

- We select the relevant variables and clean the variable names.  

- We create a year variable indicating when the data were collected.  

- Finally, we reorder variables so that the order of the variables is the same across datasets. This will be useful when we want to merge social capital data across year so that we can get descriptive statistics for each year simultaneously and that we can visualize the changes across years in social capital.  

```{r clean datasets}
#select, filter, and clean data
##election
election %<>%
  select(-office, -version, -candidate, -state) %>% #select relevant variables
  filter(year %in% c(2000, 2008, 2012, 2016)) #select relevant years

colnames(election)[1] <- "year_elctn" #rename year variable for merging

elctn_00 <- election %>% filter(year_elctn == 2000) #create a df for each election of interest so that it's easier to match them with sc dfs

s_capital_09 %<>% #create year variable before merging
  mutate(year_sc = 2009)

##social capital 2014
s_capital_14[77, 2] <- "Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, AK" #remove the repeated state code

s_capital_14 %<>% #create county and state variables
  separate(county_name, c("county","state_po"), sep = ', ') 

s_capital_14$county <- word(s_capital_14$county, 1) #remove the word 'county' and keep only the name

s_capital_14 %<>% #select relevant variables
  select(-recreational2014)

colnames(s_capital_14)[4:18] <- str_sub(colnames(s_capital_14)[4:18], end=-5) #remove the year from the variable names

s_capital_14 <- s_capital_14[, c(1:3, 10, 5, 11, 4, 12, 7:8, 6, 9, 16, 15, 13, 17, 14, 18)] #reorder the variables

s_capital_14 %<>% #create year variable before merging
  mutate(year_sc = 2014)

colnames(s_capital_14) <- colnames(s_capital_09) #rename variables to make it compatible with previous years' datasets
#Nice conservation of time and code! I would probably have retyped up everything and lament later 
```

## Merge Datasets

- First, we merge social capital data across years for reasons explained above, and call it `s_capital`.  

- Next, we merge corresponding election and social capital data for 4 time points. **In doing so,** we keep the rows that exist in both election and social capital data. For instance, if we do not have the election information for a county, we do not include it in the merged dataset even if we have that county's social capital data. These datasets are called `df_year`. *Year* denotes the year of election. Also, we remove the duplicate variables (i.e., state and county names) and fix the names. We did not remove them earlier because we first wanted to merge the social capital data with all the variables.  

- Finally, we merge all election and social capital data in the same dataset (i.e., `df`). 

```{r merge datasets}
s_capital <- bind_rows(s_capital_97, s_capital_05, s_capital_09, s_capital_14) #merge social capital data

df_00 <- inner_join(elctn_00, s_capital_97, by = "fips") #merge election 2000 & social capital 1997
df_00 <- df_00[, c(1, 25, 2:7, 10:24)] #remove duplicates and reorder variables
colnames(df_00)[3:4] <- c("state_po", "county") #rename variables

df_08 <- inner_join(elctn_08, s_capital_05, by = "fips") #merge election 2008 & social capital 2005
df_08 <- df_08[, c(1, 25, 2:7, 10:24)] #remove duplicates and reorder variables
colnames(df_08)[3:4] <- c("state_po", "county") #rename variables

df_12 <- inner_join(elctn_12, s_capital_09, by = "fips") #merge election 2012 & social capital 2009
df_12 <- df_12[, c(1, 25, 2:7, 10:24)] #remove duplicates and reorder variables
colnames(df_12)[3:4] <- c("state_po", "county") #rename variables

df_16 <- inner_join(elctn_16, s_capital_14, by = "fips") #merge election 2016 & social capital 2014
df_16 <- df_16[, c(1, 25, 2:7, 10:24)] #remove duplicates and reorder variables
colnames(df_16)[3:4] <- c("state_po", "county") #rename variables

df <- bind_rows(df_00, df_08, df_12, df_16) #merged dataset: contains all election and corresponding social capital data
```



# Introduction
Social science literature has extensively examined the relationship between social capital and politics (e.g. Morales & Guigni, 2016; Jottier & Heyndels, 2012; La Due Lake & Huckfeldt, 1998). However, relatively little is known on the impact of social capital election results.

# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->
